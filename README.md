# Stock-Watcher

## How to Run

1. Create a `.env` (dot env) file in the root of the project.

2. Add the following key to the `.env` file:

   ```
   VITE_ALPHAVANTAGE_KEY=your_alphavantage_api_key
   ```

   Note: Obtain your API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/).

3. Install the project dependencies using npm:

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

4. Run the project in development mode:

   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   This will start the development server and make the application accessible.

**Note:** Ensure you have obtained the API key from [Alpha Vantage](https://www.alphavantage.co/) and replaced `your_alphavantage_api_key` with the actual API key in the `.env` file.

Feel free to customize the instructions based on any additional setup or configuration steps required for your project.
